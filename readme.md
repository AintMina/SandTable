This is my kinetic sand art coffee table project I've been working on. The idea is derived from Sisyphus industries product and motivation is from [grammesm](https://alwaystinkering.com/2020/01/14/diy-kinetic-sand-art-table/) which was inspired by [Rob Dobson’s](https://robdobson.com/2018/08/a-new-sandbot/) version.

The table is running a Django server on a Raspberry pi 4 B 4GB which communicates to arduino nano through serial. The arduino is sitting on a [Keyestudio CNC Shield V4 For NANO](https://www.keyestudio.com/products/keyestudio-a4988-3d-printer-stepper-motor-driver-cnc-shield-v4-for-nano) which houses two TMC2208 stepper motor drivers.

The user interface is very simple and basic due to my lack of UI designing skills.
